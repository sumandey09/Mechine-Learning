Credit Card Fraud Detection with Machine Learning
Welcome to my repository showcasing projects on credit card fraud detection using machine learning techniques. As the prevalence of online transactions increases, so does the risk of fraudulent activities. These projects aim to tackle this issue by leveraging machine learning algorithms to identify and prevent fraudulent transactions.

Projects Included:
Supervised Learning Models: Explore various supervised learning approaches such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines (SVM) applied to credit card fraud detection datasets. Evaluate the performance of each model in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Unsupervised Learning Techniques: Delve into unsupervised learning methods like k-means clustering and isolation forests to detect anomalies in credit card transactions without the need for labeled data. Assess the effectiveness of these techniques in detecting fraudulent patterns.

Deep Learning Approaches: Investigate deep learning architectures such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for detecting complex patterns in credit card transactions. Experiment with different network architectures and hyperparameters to optimize performance.

Usage:
Dataset Preparation: Download or import credit card transaction datasets from reliable sources. Preprocess the data by handling missing values, scaling features, and encoding categorical variables.

Model Implementation: Implement machine learning and deep learning models using libraries such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch. Train the models on labeled datasets and fine-tune hyperparameters to achieve optimal performance.

Evaluation and Deployment: Evaluate the trained models using appropriate metrics and cross-validation techniques. Deploy the best-performing model into production for real-time fraud detection in credit card transactions.

Feel free to explore the projects and contribute to further advancements in credit card fraud detection using machine learning!
